<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>The Pitch’n Volunteer Management System (PVMS) is a web-application that assists a manager of an organization in finding a volunteer, based on the volunteer’s skills, location, availability, current projects and other keywords. The application will be available through the non-profit organization Pitch’n Solutions.</p>
 
<p>Organizations are able to import their current list of volunteers into the database using the designated features on the web app. This list will contain the information of each volunteer in that organization, including the parameters that managers would like to use for filtering volunteers. Additionally, Administrators at Pitch’n can use the web application to oversee the system and assist managers with troubleshooting. For instance, after clients provide permission, administrators can edit the organization’s information as well as manage projects.</p>
   
 
<p>This software requires an internet connection to fetch and query results. Information is maintained in a database, located on a webserver that Pitch’n will create and maintain. By using the PVMS, managers are able to organize their volunteers, and volunteers are able to manage their tasks and responsibilities. This application may have the capability of producing progress reports for both projects and individual volunteers. The software does not interact with Pitch’n’s volunteer recruitment or volunteer matching systems. The PVMS is not responsible for data encryption.</p>
